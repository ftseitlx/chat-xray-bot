Alice: Hi Bob, how are you today?
Bob: I'm good, thanks for asking! How about you?
Alice: I'm doing well too. I was wondering if you'd like to grab coffee sometime this week?
Bob: That sounds great! How about Wednesday afternoon?
Alice: Wednesday works for me. Let's meet at that new caf√© downtown.
Bob: Perfect! Looking forward to it.
Alice: Me too! See you then.
Bob: See you on Wednesday!
